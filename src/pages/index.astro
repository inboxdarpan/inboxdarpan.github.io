        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>
            My entrepreneurial journey spans across multiple ventures and collaborations with industry leaders. I've founded two startups - one venture-backed and another bootstrapped - each teaching me invaluable lessons about building and scaling technology companies. My experience working with two Unicorns has given me deep insights into scaling operations and managing high-performing teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of helping numerous startups build their technology products from the ground up. This hands-on experience has taught me the intricacies of product development, team building, and scaling operations. I combine this practical knowledge with strategic thinking to help startups navigate their growth journey effectively.
